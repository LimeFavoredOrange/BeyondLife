# Digital Will App ðŸ“±

This repository contains the source code for the **Digital Will App**, a React Native Expo project that provides a secure and user-friendly platform for creating and managing digital legacy.
The code in this repo is a static version to protect account privacy and backend server information. However, the data files included are real and were saved from actual server interactions. In a real-world scenario, this app would interact with a backend server. You can run it locally or access it using the pre-packaged Expo link. Please refer to the following sections for more details.
